# BP-term
Back-Projection based Fidelity Term for Ill-Posed Linear Inverse Problems

Applying ISTA (proximal gradient method) on the BP-term + prior is similar to the IDBP baseline https://github.com/tomtirer/IDBP.
Clearner code with extension to FISTA (simply by Nesterov's accelerated gradient) will be uploaded soon.

TensorFlow implementation for recovery based on DCGAN prior and BP cost will be uploaded soon as well.
